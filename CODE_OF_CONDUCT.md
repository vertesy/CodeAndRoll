## Code of Conduct

1. Be ***collaborative***, please let me know if something does not work, so I can fix it for you and for others. I appreciate your input.
2. Be ***patient***, I try to be fast, but please accept that some things may not be followed up.
3. Try to be ***concise*** to help getting to the point quickly.
4. Be ***respectful*** to others, I try to be too.
